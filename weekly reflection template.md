# Willpower & habit building

### Did you stick to your habit in maintenance?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No, so I will..

Did you:
- [ ] 🔥 Live at the edge of your ability (willpower struggle)?
- [ ] 👂 Did you listen enough? Did you ask questions, without speaking?
- [ ] 🐲 Say no to most things?
- [ ] 🧠 Did you intentionally *dedicate* flow states?
- [ ] 🧠 Did you _improve thinking_ with your second brain?
- [ ] 📚 Did you read consistently?
- [ ] ❤️ Feel love and give love, regardless of how you feel?
- [ ] 🧠 Very little distractions (insta, mail, conversation)?
- [ ] 🤣 Laughing and socializing with meaningful people?
- [ ] 🥕 Healthy eating?
- [ ] ☺️ Real alone time?
- [ ] 👏 Live by the four stoic cardinal virtues (justice, temperance, fortitude, prudence)?
- [ ] 🍽 Fasting?
- [ ] 🔮 Think in second order consequences?

Remember flow-killing habits:
- Work with phone close to my desk
- Instant messaging
- Procrastinate
- Spend psychic energy on food choices, clothing choices, relationship issues, superficial socializing

**Remember**: the first 10 minutes of a 90 minute (altradian rhythm) deep work block are always going to be hard. That's okay.
